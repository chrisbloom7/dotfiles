log_info "Restoring symlinks after mackup uninstall"

# Mackup currently has a bug that makes it dangerous to use with Sonoma. The
# workaround is to run `mackup backup --force` or `mackup restore --force` and then
# immediately run `mackup uninstall --force`. This tricks Mackup into creating or
# restoring the backup files, during which it's usual symlinking process will
# fail. Then, when it tries to uninstall, it will copy the files back to their
# original locations. This script will then symlink files that were linked in
# the setup script in case Mackup trampled on them.
