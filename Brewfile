#
# Tips: https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f
#
## Usage:
#
#    brew bundle [install]
#    brew bundle [install] --cleanup
#    brew bundle [install] --file=~/.private/Brewfile
#
## Generate a Brewfile from your currently installed packages:
#
#    brew bundle dump
#    brew bundle dump --force
#    brew bundle dump --file=~/.private/Brewfile
#    brew bundle dump --all --describe --file=-
#
## Ways to control which formulae and casks are selected:
#
### Install only on specified OS:
#
#    brew "gnupg" if OS.mac?
#    brew "glibc" if OS.linux?
#
### Install only if a command succeeds or fails fails:
#
#    cask "java" unless system "/usr/libexec/java_home", "--failfast"
#
### Options for formulae and casks:
#
#    args            : array[string]
#    conflicts_with  : array[string]
#    link            : boolean
#    restart_service : boolean
#    start_service   : boolean

# Set arguments for installing casks
# https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/USAGE.md#options
# Tip: Use `force: true` to override `require_sha: true` on individual casks
cask_args require_sha: true, no_quarantine: true

## Extension Packs
#
# Brew bundle doesn't do a good job of managing extension packs. Currently you
# must specify the extension pack name and the individual extensions, otherwise
# `brew bundle install --cleanup` will remove any extensions in the pack that
# are not explicitly listed in the Brewfile.
