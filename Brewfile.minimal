## Extension Packs
#
# Brew bundle doesn't do a good job of managing extension packs. Currently you
# must specify the extension pack name and the individual extensions, otherwise
# `brew bundle install --cleanup` will remove any extensions in the pack that
# are not explicitly listed in the Brewfile.
